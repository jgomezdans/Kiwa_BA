Getting hold of the data
*****************************

The first step is to get hold of all available data. In principle, 
we will use the `GLOVIS website <http://glovis.usgs.gov>`_ from the 
USGS to list all available acquisitions from both Landsat 5 TM and 
Landsat 7 ETM, order and download the data.
